Compiler Bugs and Things to do
------------------------------

^this.that => parses as (^this).that not ^(this.that)

Supplying non polymorphic parameter to polymorphic constrained function fails
int input to fn Test(Array:(int)) => should not match Test

pointer.field => should automatically append a dereference to pointer 

 l * (1.0/r) includes an expression list of when it probably shouldn't

(r.chars + r.length) = 0 crashes should say cant assign 0 to ^
